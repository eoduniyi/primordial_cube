# Deep Learning and Physical Chemistry for Glass Simulation

In this project we'll review tools for simulating [actual_thing] using [actual_thing]

## Background

### Deep Learning

### Quantum Statistical Mechanics

On one hand, glass is a relatively simple material. This may be a sort of availability bias as glass is ubiquitous. That is, the multipurpose and specialized applications (e.g., glassware for drinking water, liquid crystal displays, etc.) of glass has enabled humans to construct shelter and tools for ourselves and hence appear so natural or common in human life. It may also be the properties of glass, namely transparency that give rise to its misleading perception of simplicity. On the other hand, we know computer processors are complex integrated systems, which are also ubiquitous. For the modern world, computers are necessary. Both glass and computer processors are human artifacts. One distinction between the two is that people can see through glass while most people (due to careful abstraction) are by design unaware of the very- and ultra- large scale integrated circuits which enable the glass to present meaningful information. In fact, these artifacts have co-evolved into interfaces for operating such very large integrated systems (e.g., electronic devices and appliances). Which again, enable humanity's almost fantastical capacity to compute and communicate at varying scales.

And how these artifacts come to be is from silicon. Silicon, *"a chemical element with the symbol Si and atomic number 14. It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic luster, and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor."* - *Wikipedia*
